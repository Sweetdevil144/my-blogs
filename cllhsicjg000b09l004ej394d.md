Greetings, fellow tech enthusiasts! üöÄ

In the midst of our rapid technological advancements, it's easy to forget the gadgets and systems that once paved the way for the innovations we enjoy today. As someone who's usually deep in the code trenches or navigating the latest tech developments, I find it fascinating to look back at the foundational pieces of tech that have become obsolete. If you haven't used a DVD or a Floppy, you are too young to be called a programmer. Let's delve into some of these technological relics and appreciate their significance in our tech journey.

**The Floppy Disk: Data's Humble Beginnings** üéû

In today's age of massive cloud storages and lightning-fast SSDs, it's almost poetic to think back to the time of the floppy disk. Remember when these plastic squares, with their protective metal slide, were the very essence of data portability? Those 1.44 MB of storage might draw a chuckle when compared to today's terabytes, but they were the trusted allies of many, whether for saving a school project , booting up an operating system or sending Humans to the Moon. The tactile satisfaction of sliding one into a drive, hearing it whirl and access data, is something that's lost in today's touch-and-swipe era.

**Pagers: The Dawn of Instant Communication** üìü

Long before the noisy pings from our smartphones became the norm, there was the subtle beep of the pager. Clipped to belts or tucked into shirt pockets, these devices were the epitome of being 'connected'. The anticipation of seeing a new number pop up, and then finding a phone to return the call, was a ritual for many. In a way, they were the unsung heroes, silently vibrating, bridging gaps, and keeping people in touch in a world that wasn‚Äôt yet fully online.

**VHS Tapes: Analog Entertainment** üìº

The tactile joy of holding a VHS, with its rectangular solidity and the gentle whirr as you rewound a tape, is a memory etched in many of our hearts. Although, I personally never had a chance to hold one, it was really fascinating for me to see the Hollowood stars popping one into a VCR as they went on to their Friday night parties.

**Sony's Walkman and Discman: The Evolution of Portable Music** üéß

Picture this: a sunny day, a Walkman clipped to your belt, headphones on, and the world fades away as the cassette plays your favorite tunes. Or the Discman, with its anti-skip technology, making it possible to carry a CD's worth of music on the go. These weren‚Äôt just devices; they were statements. In my days, if you owned any one of these, you were considered the richest and the collest person in the hood. Before playlists were crafted with algorithms, we had mixtapes and CDs, carefully curated, often replayed, and deeply cherished.

Looking back, it's evident that while these technologies have become obsolete, they played crucial roles in shaping the tech landscape we navigate today. It serves as a reminder that innovation is a continuous journey, and what's cutting-edge now may be a fond memory in the future.

I hope you enjoyed my perspective on the ever-changing world. It's astounding to see how far we've come in today's age. This blog was **MY** way of expressing gratitude to the long-gone Fancy Tech Era. üöÄ

The pace of technology is relentless. While we embrace the new, we must never forget the roots that laid the foundation. If our forefathers hadn't developed these technologies, would the Apollo mission have succeeded?
Until our next tech exploration, stay curious and keep innovating. üíªüòÅ
