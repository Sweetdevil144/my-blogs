### **Step-by-Step Installation Guide**

#### **Dual Boot with Windows**:

1. **Backup**: Always back up important files. While the installation is usually safe, it‚Äôs best to be prepared.
    
2. **Create a Bootable Pendrive**:
    
    * Install and run Balena Etcher.
        
    * Select the downloaded Ubuntu 22.04 ISO and your pendrive.
        
    * Click ‚ÄúFlash!‚Äù to create your bootable drive.
        
3. **Partition Your Drive**:
    
    * In Windows, open 'Disk Management'.
        
    * Shrink your primary partition by the desired amount (at least 60GB is recommended).
        
    * This will create an 'Unallocated' space where Linux will be installed.
        
4. **Install Linux**:
    
    * Restart your computer and boot from the pendrive (this often involves pressing F12, F2, or the DEL key during startup).
        
    * When presented with the Ubuntu setup, choose 'Install Ubuntu'.
        
    * When asked about installation type, select 'Install alongside Windows'.
        
    * Follow on-screen instructions, and select the 'unallocated' space when prompted for the installation location.
        
5. **GRUB Bootloader**:
    
    * Post-installation, your computer will use the GRUB bootloader. It allows you to choose between Windows and Linux at startup.
        

#### **Bootcamp for Mac**:

1. **Backup**: Ensure all your data is backed up using Time Machine or another backup solution.
    
2. **Install UTM**:
    
    * Download and run the UTM application.
        
3. **Setup a New Virtual Machine (VM)**:
    
    * Click ‚Äú+‚Äù in UTM to create a new VM.
        
    * Name your VM, choose the OS type as Linux, and select the downloaded Ubuntu ARM64 ISO as your installation media.
        
4. **Allocate Resources**:
    
    * Assign at least 2 cores and 4GB RAM to your VM for optimal performance. Adjust the disk size based on your needs.
        
5. **Install Linux**:
    
    * Start the VM and follow the on-screen instructions to install Ubuntu.
        
6. **Accessing Ubuntu**:
    
    * Whenever you wish to use Linux, open UTM and run your VM.
